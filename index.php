		<h1>Persona</h1>
			<p>
				Elaine Atwood is a 21 year-old computer science undergraduate at the University of California, Los
				Angeles.  While she doesn't have as much time these days to devote to it, since she was a little girl,
				she has been making jewelry as gifts for friends and family.  Both to keep in practice and to bring in a
				little extra money for those long nights in the coffee shop finishing projects, she wants a quick and
				simple way to sell what she creates.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her main method of staying connected with the world is her previous model-year 13" Macbook Pro.  However,
				she also has an iPhone 7 that she mostly uses for checking on the status of her friends, sending quick
				messages, and taking photographs.  School keeps her quite busy these days, so she doesn't have much free
				time, and much of that goes to her jewelry-making hobby.  She want things to just work so she doesn't
				have to waste her valuable time troubleshooting issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				Her goal with using this site is quite simple: she wants to be able quickly and easily list for sale items
				that she has made.  Then, when those items sell, she wants the profits from the sale to be securely
				transferred into her bank account.
			</p>
		<h1>Use Case</h1>

					<li>Elaine clicks on the sign in button and enters her credentials into the fields.</li>
					<li>The website checks her credentials against those on file.</li>
					<li>When it sees the correct information, it sends her phone a two-factor authentication code and
						her browser a page requesting she enter the code.</li>
					<li>Elaine checks her phone for the code and enters it into the box in her browser.</li>
					<li>The website again checks that code entered is correct, then returns her personal profile page.</li>
