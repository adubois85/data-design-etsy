		<h1>Persona</h1>
			<p>
				Elaine Atwood is a 21 year-old computer science undergraduate at the University of California, Los
				Angeles.  While she doesn't have as much time these days to devote to it, since she was a little girl,
				she has been making jewelry as gifts for friends and family.  Both to keep in practice and to bring in a
				little extra money for those long nights in the coffee shop finishing projects, she wants a quick and
				simple way to sell what she creates.
